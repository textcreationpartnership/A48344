            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

All which have found good acceptance in the World, as may appear by the ſeverall <hi>Editions</hi> which ſome of them have paſſed the Preſs: I thought good at length to publiſh ſomething that might be <hi>uſefull</hi> and <hi>beneficial</hi> for my <hi>Country-men, Engliſh Navigators;</hi> hoping that I ſhall receive from them (for the pains I have already, and hereafter ſhall take for their good and advantage) no leſs En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement by their acceptance of what (out of free good will) I tender to them, then I have already from others, for what I have made publick for their Uſe and Service.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Nine</hi> following <hi>Treatiſes</hi> I have furniſhed the <hi>Young Sea-man</hi> with ſuch practical <hi>Exerciſes</hi> as tend wholly to his <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment</hi> at <hi>Sea:</hi> beginning, firſt, with ſome few <hi>Geometricall Rudiments</hi> that are abſolutely neceſſary for him to underſtand and be perfect in the Practice of, before he launch farther into the <hi>Mathematicall Ocean.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From theſe <hi>Elements,</hi> I proceed to the <hi>Geometricall Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of <hi>Triangles</hi> both <hi>Plain</hi> and <hi>Sphericall,</hi> upon the <hi>Solution</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:30341:4"/> whereof all the <hi>Practick Parts</hi> of the <hi>Mathematicks</hi> do depend. For on the <hi>Solution</hi> of <hi>Right-lined Triangles,</hi> all <hi>Propoſitions</hi> which concern <hi>Longimetria,</hi> or the Meaſuring of <hi>Heights, Depths</hi> and <hi>Diſtances,</hi> either upon the <hi>Land</hi> or at <hi>Sea;</hi> all in <hi>Planometria,</hi> as Meaſuring of <hi>Land, Board, Glaſs, Pavements, Hangings,</hi> &amp;c. all in <hi>Striometria,</hi> or the Menſuration of <hi>Solids,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Stone, Timber,</hi> and the like; all Problems of <hi>Sailing,</hi> both by the <hi>Plain Sea-Chart,</hi> and alſo by that of <hi>Mercator</hi>'s Projection; all that concerns <hi>Fortification, Gunnery,</hi> &amp;c. have their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.—And by the <hi>Solution</hi> of <hi>Sphericall Triangles, Problems</hi> in <hi>Aſtronomie, Geography, Sailing by the Arch of a great Circle, Dialling,</hi> Meaſuring of the Diſtance of <hi>Stars, Comets,</hi> &amp;c. are to be reſolved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Trigonometria,</hi> therefore, being the <hi>Baſis</hi> or <hi>Foundation</hi> upon which the forementioned <hi>Superſtructures</hi> are <hi>erected;</hi> I choſe firſt to begin with that. And how I have performed it, and to what Uſes I have applied it, which tend to the Practice of <hi>the Art of Navigation,</hi> the <hi>Contents</hi> of the ſeverall <hi>Exerciſes</hi> will (in part) declare.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Geometricall reſolving</hi> of <hi>Triangles</hi> both <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>ſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall,</hi> I have gone in a <hi>Path</hi> not before <hi>beaten.</hi> And therefore, if I have at any time gone out of my way, either by <hi>deficiency</hi> or <hi>redundancy,</hi> I hope the <hi>Reader</hi> will pardon me. I am ſure the ingenious <hi>Mathematician</hi> (who (at firſt ſight) will diſcover the manner and waies of Working, and alſo the Ground and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration thereof) will not <hi>carp</hi> or <hi>cavilat,</hi> but rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form <hi>me</hi> or the <hi>Reader</hi> of any ſuch <hi>Deviation.</hi> But in the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of every <hi>Exerciſe,</hi> I have therein retained ſuch a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,</hi> that I could not well ſtep aſide. And for the certainty of the manner of the <hi>Geometricall Operations,</hi> (if they be carefully performed) I dare aver that you may (if the Radius of your Line of Chords be but 4 or 5 <hi>Inches</hi>) come within a few Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes of Calculation; which will be ſufficient for the <hi>Sea-man's <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> for him thereby to reſolve ſuch <hi>Problems</hi> in <hi>Aſtronomie, Geography</hi> or <hi>Navigation,</hi> as at any time he ſhall (in his Practice)
<pb facs="tcp:30341:4"/> have occaſion for. And that Proof or Triall may be made thereof, (though I could in a few Lines demonſtrate the nature and manner of Working) I have to every <hi>Caſe, Propoſition</hi> and <hi>Problem</hi> in the whole <hi>Work</hi> contained, added the <hi>Analogies</hi> or <hi>Proportions</hi> by which they may be <hi>ſolved</hi> by the <hi>Canons</hi> of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial Sines</hi> and <hi>Tangents,</hi> and the <hi>Chiliads</hi> of <hi>Logarithms:</hi> So that ſuch as have thoſe Tables (and know their Uſe) may work any <hi>Propoſition</hi> by them, and by that diſcover the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between <hi>Calculation</hi> and this <hi>Geometricall</hi> way of <hi>Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

            <p>And that the <hi>young Sea-man</hi> may not (at any time) be to ſeek of <hi>Tools</hi> to work with, (in caſe of any Miſcarriage at Sea) I have not onely ſhewed him how to <hi>uſe,</hi> but alſo the manner how to <hi>make,</hi> all ſuch <hi>Inſtruments</hi> as will be in uſe to him in the Practice of theſe <hi>Exerciſes:</hi> As of his <hi>Line of Chords,</hi> which is the chief; and alſo of a <hi>Sea-Chart</hi> according to <hi>Mercator</hi>'s Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, without the help of a <hi>Table</hi> of <hi>Meridionall Parts,</hi> or a <hi>Meridian Line,</hi> but <hi>eaſily</hi> and <hi>ſpeedily</hi> by a <hi>Line of Chords</hi> onely; and that either <hi>General,</hi> from the <hi>Aequinoctial</hi> towards either <hi>Pole;</hi> or <hi>Particular,</hi> for any deſigned <hi>Navigation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, in the Working of the ſeverall <hi>Queſtions</hi> by <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator</hi>'s <hi>Chart,</hi> I have, at the end of every <hi>Problem,</hi> given an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Difference ariſing between Working by that and the <hi>Plain Sea-Chart;</hi> whereby the <hi>Errours</hi> of the one are clearly detected, and the <hi>Verity</hi> of the other diſcovered.</p>
            <p>I might have proceeded farther, to the performance of other things by the <hi>Line of Chords</hi> onely; as to ſhew the manner of <hi>Sailing</hi> by the <hi>Arch of a great Circle:</hi> but that, with ſome other things tending to <hi>Navigation,</hi> I ſhall ſhortly make publick in a <hi>Treatiſe</hi> formerly written by my ſelf and Mr. <hi>Vincent Wing,</hi> now in my hands, and almoſt ready for the <hi>Preſs,</hi> and wholly deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Uſe of <hi>Sea-men.</hi>—And for farther Uſe of this Line, I have in a Treatiſe (now in the Preſs) taught the manner how to delineate all manner of <hi>Sun-Dials</hi> by <hi>projecting</hi> of the <hi>Sphere in Plano,</hi> whereby not onely the <hi>Making,</hi> but the <hi>Reaſon</hi> alſo, of
<pb facs="tcp:30341:5"/> 
               <hi>Dials</hi> is diſcovered. To which Treatiſe (if my preſent occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will permit) I ſhall adde both an Arithmeticall and an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall way of <hi>Dialling</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p>Thus, friendly Reader, at preſent, I preſent thee with This; and in a few Months thou ſhalt (God willing) participate of thoſe above mentioned. All which I hope will be as kindly accepted, as they are freely tendered by</p>

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:30341:12"/> As the Angle A C B of the Triangle containeth 53 degr. 7. min. the Complement whereof is 36 degr. 53 min. which is ſo much as 53 degr. 7 min. wanteth of 90 degr. For if you ſubtract 53 degr. 37 min. from 90 degr. (or from 89 degr. 60 min. for eaſe in ſubtracting) the remainder will be 36 degr. 53 min.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Complement of an Angle to a Semicircle is ſo much as that Angle wanteth of 180 degr. So the Angle C being 53 degr. 7 min. take 53 degr. 7 min. from 180 degr.

As in the Triangle C A B, if you have the Angle at C 53 degr. 7 min. given, you have alſo the Angle at B given, it being the Complement of that at C to 90 degr. wherefore take 53 degr. 7 min. from

                  <p>BY the <hi>Precepts</hi> before in this <hi>Treatiſe</hi> delivered you have the whole <hi>Doctrine</hi> both of <hi>plain Right-lined Triangles,</hi> and alſo of <hi>Sphericall</hi> both <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Oblique-angled,</hi> wrought by a way not uſually practiſed, which if it be carefully performed, you may by a <hi>Line of Chords</hi> of <hi>3</hi> or <hi>4</hi> inches <hi>Radius</hi> come within a few minutes of <hi>Calculation;</hi> which will be of ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent uſe for any Practice either in <hi>Aſtronomicall, Geographicall</hi> or <hi>Nauticall Queſtions,</hi> wrought thereby. And if in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of any of the <hi>Caſes</hi> there be any difficulty, it is <hi>in the moving of the Compaſſes along one Line, while the other foot, being turned about, doth only touch another Line.</hi> But this is not a real, but a ſeeming, difficulty; for in <hi>3</hi> or <hi>4</hi> times trial you will finde it very expeditious and eaſie: and although it be not ſo Geometricall as the way by drawing of Parallels, yet it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as exact; more ready and ſpeedy in performance, and avoids the drawing of multiplicity of Lines, which would much cumber the Diagrams to no purpoſe. If the Schemes that are here drawn ſeem to be cumbred with multiplicity of Lines, the reaſon is, becauſe many of them ſerve for <hi>3, 4,</hi> or <hi>5 Caſes;</hi> but if a particular Diagram had been drawn for every <hi>Caſe,</hi> then none of them would have conſiſted of above <hi>5</hi> Lines beſides the Quadrant, as you will ſee by trying of any <hi>Caſe.</hi> And here note, that every one of theſe <hi>Caſes,</hi> both in <hi>Right-lined</hi> and <hi>Sphericall Triangles,</hi> is applicable to ſome one thing or other in the Practice of the <hi>Mathematicks.</hi> As, by <hi>plain Right-lined Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angles</hi> all Propoſitions are reſolved that concern the taking of <hi>Heights, Depths</hi> and <hi>Diſtances, Meaſuring</hi> of <hi>Land, Sailing</hi> by the <hi>plain Sea-Chart,</hi> and alſo by <hi>Mercator</hi>'s, and divers other particulars. The Solution of <hi>Sphericall Triangles</hi> reſolves Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions in <hi>Aſtronomy, Geography, Dialling, Sailing by the Arch of a great Circle,</hi> with many other particulars too tedious here

                  <p>And becauſe the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Sphericall Triangles</hi> is more difficult then that of <hi>Plain Triangles,</hi> I will in this next Treatiſe following ſhew you how (by your Line of Chords onely) you may <hi>draw</hi> or <hi>project</hi> the <hi>Globe</hi> or <hi>Sphere</hi> upon a <hi>Plain;</hi> by which means you may ſee before you how the <hi>Sphericall Triangles</hi> lie in the <hi>Sphere</hi> it ſelf; which will be a great help to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the nature of a <hi>Sphericall Triangle.</hi> The <hi>Sphere</hi> being thus projected upon a Plain, I will ſhew how (upon that Plain) to meaſure both the <hi>Sides</hi> and <hi>Angles</hi> of a <hi>Spheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Triangle,</hi> and, in ſo doing, reſolve ſome Queſtions in <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy;</hi> by which you may diſcern, in that particular, how ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient <hi>Trigonometry</hi> is to <hi>Aſtronomy,</hi> and, as the Proverb is, <hi>judge of</hi> Hercules <hi>by his Foot:</hi> for to inſtance in the Variety of things that the Doctrine of <hi>Triangles</hi> is aſſiſtent to, were an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Work.</p>

                     <p>Fourthly, draw a right Line ♋ A ♑ between the two <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks,</hi> touching the <hi>Tropick of Cancer</hi> above the <hi>Horizon</hi> at ♋, and the <hi>Tropick of Capricorn</hi> below the <hi>Horizon</hi> at the Point ♑.—This Circle hath upon it the Characters of the 12 Signs of the <hi>Zodiac,</hi> which are to be put on in this manner.—Take 23 d. 30 min. out of your Line of Chords, and ſet them from P to Q, and from S to R: which Points, Q and R, are the two <hi>Poles</hi> of the <hi>Ecliptick.</hi> Then take 60 degr. from your Line of Chords, and ſet them from Q to 1, and from Q to 3. Alſo ſet the ſame diſtance from ♋ to 2, and from ♑ to 4.—This done, lay a Ruler to the Pole R and the figure 1, it will cut the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> in the Point ♊ and ♌: the Ruler laid to R and 2 will cut it in the Point ♉ and ♍; and laid to R and 4, in ♏ and ♓; and laid to R and 3, in ♐ and ♒. So have you the true Points for the Sun's entrance into every Sign. And if you would have every tenth degree of each Sign, divide every of the Spaces ♋ 1, 12, 2 Q, Q 4, 4 3, and 3 ♑, into three equal parts; ſo will each part contain 10 d. and a Ruler laid to each of them and the Point R ſhall give you the Points upon the <hi>Ecliptick</hi> anſwering to the 10. degr. of every Sign. And in the ſame manner may you (if your Projection be large) put on every Degree.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, for the putting on of the <hi>Hour-Circles;</hi> conſider how far the Circle you are to put on is diſtant from the <hi>Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian,</hi> and ſet ſo many degrees upon the <hi>Meridian</hi> from the <hi>Aequinoctial:</hi> a Ruler laid from Z to thoſe degrees will croſs the <hi>Aequinoctial,</hi> and through that Point in the <hi>Aequinoctial</hi> where the Ruler ſo croſſeth, the <hi>Hour-Circle</hi> will paſs.—Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: The <hi>Hour-Circle</hi> P B S, in this Projection, is diſtant from the <hi>Meridian</hi> 62 d. 46 m. wherefore take 62 d. 46 m. from your Chords, and ſet them from <hi>a</hi> to <hi>b;</hi> then laying a Ruler from Z to <hi>b,</hi> it will cut the <hi>Aequinoctial</hi> in B, through which Point the <hi>Hour-Circle</hi> of 62 d. 46 m. muſt paſs.—To find the Centre of this <hi>Hour-Circle,</hi> (and ſo of any other) repair to the former Scheme for finding of the Centres of the <hi>Parallels</hi> of <hi>Altitude</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination;</hi>
                        <pb n="79" facs="tcp:30341:45"/> and (becauſe this <hi>Hour-Circle</hi> is diſtant from the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian</hi> 62 degr. 46 min.) take 62 degr. 46 min. from your Line of Chords, and ſet them upon the Quadrant A B C, from C to <hi>l,</hi> and draw the Line A <hi>l m.</hi> So ſhall the Line A <hi>l m</hi> be the Semidiameter of the <hi>Hour-Circle</hi> P B S; which being taken in your Compaſſes, and ſet upon your Projection from B, upon the Line B AE, (being extended,) ſhall there give you the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of that <hi>Hour-Circle.</hi> And in the ſame manner may the Centres of all the reſt be found.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, the <hi>Azimuth Circles</hi> are to be drawn upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and the Centres of them found in all reſpects as the <hi>Hour-Circles</hi> were.—So the <hi>Azimuth Circle</hi> Z ☉ N, being 56 degr. 40 min. from the <hi>Meridian,</hi> take 56 degr. 41 min. out of your Line of Chords, and ſet them upon the <hi>Meridian</hi> of your Projection from O to <hi>d;</hi> then laying a Ruler unto Z and <hi>d,</hi> it will cut the <hi>Horizon</hi> in the Point ☉ through which the <hi>Azimuth</hi> of 56 degr. 41 min. Z ☉ N, muſt paſs.—Then, to find its Centre, repair to the former Scheme for finding of Centres, and upon the Quadrant A B C ſet 56 degr. 41 min. of your Chords, from C to <hi>n,</hi> and draw the Line A <hi>u o:</hi> ſo ſhall the Line A <hi>u o</hi> be the Semidiameter of the <hi>Azimuth Circle</hi> Z ☉ N; which being taken in your Compaſſes, and ſet upon your Projection from ☉, upon the Line ☉ H, (being extended,) ſhall there give you the Centre of the <hi>Azimuth Circle</hi> Z ☉ N. And in this manner may the Centre of any other <hi>Azimuth Circle</hi> be found.</p>
                     <p>And here note (I.) <hi>That the Centres of all</hi> Azimuth Circles <hi>fall in the</hi> Horizon <hi>H A D, being extended where need is. The Centres of all the</hi> Hour-Circles <hi>fall in the</hi> Aequinoctial <hi>Line AE A ae, being extended. The Centres of the</hi> Tropicks <hi>and</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allels <hi>of</hi> Declination <hi>fall in the</hi> Axis of the World <hi>P A S, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. And the Centres of the Circles of</hi> Altitude <hi>fall in the</hi> Prime Verticall <hi>Circle Z A N.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Note (II.) <hi>That if the middle Point of any</hi> Hour-Circle <hi>do not fall juſt in the</hi> Aequinoctial, <hi>or any</hi> Azimuth Circle <hi>juſt in
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:30341:46"/> the</hi> Horizon, <hi>but on either ſide of them; then you may find the Centres by the</hi> Geometricall Propoſitions <hi>at the beginning of this Book; though there be other waies to find the Centres upon the</hi> Projection <hi>it ſelf, which I omit, for that I would not cumber the Scheme with unneceſſary Lines.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Seventhly, Every Circle in the Projection hath its proper <hi>Pole,</hi> as was before intimated. Now for the finding of them, you are to note, that the <hi>Pole</hi> of every <hi>great Circle</hi> is 90 degr. or a <hi>Quadrant</hi> of a Circle, diſtant from the Circle it ſelf, upon that Line which cutteth the Circle at right Angles. Thus the <hi>Poles</hi> of all the <hi>Hour-Circles</hi> are upon the <hi>Aequinoctial,</hi> and the <hi>Poles</hi> of all the <hi>Azimuths</hi> upon the <hi>Horizon.</hi>—Now if you would find the <hi>Pole</hi> of the <hi>Hour-Circle</hi> P D S, lay a Ruler up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on P and D, and it will cut the <hi>Meridian</hi> Circle in <hi>e:</hi> then take 90 degr. of your Line of Chords, and ſet them from <hi>e</hi> to <hi>f,</hi> a Ruler laid from P to <hi>f</hi> will cut the <hi>Aequinoctial</hi> in Y: ſo is Y the <hi>Pole</hi> of the <hi>Hour-Circle</hi> P D S.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, The finding of the <hi>Poles</hi> of the <hi>Azimuth Circles</hi> is the ſame with the <hi>Hour-Circles.</hi> So if you would find the <hi>Pole</hi> of the <hi>Azimuth Circle</hi> Z G N, lay a Ruler upon Z and G, it will cut the <hi>Meridian</hi> Circle in <hi>g;</hi> then ſet 90 degr. of your Chord from <hi>g</hi> to <hi>d,</hi> ſo a Ruler laid from Z to <hi>d</hi> will cut the <hi>Horizon</hi> H A O in the Point ☉, which Point ☉ is the <hi>Pole</hi> of the <hi>Azimuth Circle</hi> Z G N. And thus have you found the <hi>Poles</hi> of one of the <hi>Hour</hi> and one of the <hi>Azimuth</hi> Circles. And by the ſame manner of Work you may find the <hi>Poles</hi> of all the reſt. As</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Of the Two firſt, the one is called <hi>Plain Sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> or, <hi>Sailing</hi> by the <hi>Plain Sea-Chart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The other is called <hi>Mercator</hi>'s <hi>Sailing,</hi> or, <hi>Sailing</hi> by <hi>Merca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>'s <hi>Chart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe two <hi>Charts</hi> are both of them compoſed of <hi>Right Lines,</hi> yet differ both in their <hi>Conſtruction</hi> and <hi>Uſe,</hi> though not ſo much in their <hi>Uſe</hi> as in their <hi>making</hi> or <hi>compoſition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Plain Sea-Chart</hi> conſiſteth of <hi>Meridians</hi> and <hi>Parallels,</hi> which are drawn in all parts equal from the <hi>Aequinoctial</hi> towards either of the <hi>Poles;</hi> which is erroneous, as hereafter ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Mercator</hi>'s <hi>Chart</hi> hath the Degrees of <hi>Longitude</hi> in every <hi>Parallel of Latitude</hi> equal to thoſe in the <hi>Aequinoctial,</hi> as the <hi>Plain Chart</hi> hath: But the Degrees of <hi>Latitude</hi> do increaſe more and more (as they grow nearer the <hi>Poles</hi>) in ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as every <hi>Parallel of Longitude</hi> doth decreaſe.</p>
                  <p>The way of Sailing by the <hi>Plain Sea-Chart</hi> is much in uſe, nay too much, conſidering the <hi>Errours</hi> that it leads <hi>Sea-men</hi> into; though they are not ſo eaſily diſcovered in <hi>ſhort</hi> as in <hi>long Voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,</hi> nor in <hi>places near</hi> the <hi>Aequinoctial</hi> as thoſe <hi>nearer</hi> the <hi>Poles.</hi> But, I ſuppoſe, it is more uſed, for the eaſe there is in <hi>Projecting</hi> of this <hi>Chart,</hi> more then in that of <hi>Mercator</hi>'s: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I know not why that ſhould be ſo as it is embraced, and the other (I mean that of <hi>Mercator</hi>'s) ſo much neglected; which comes ſo near to the <hi>Spherical</hi> way of <hi>Sailing,</hi> that there is an inſenſible difference between them. But I ſhall bring them <hi>face</hi> to <hi>face,</hi> that the <hi>ingenious Sea-man</hi> may ſee their Difference, and thereby abandon <hi>Errour,</hi> and embrace the <hi>Truth.</hi> For in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Problems</hi> I ſhall perform the <hi>ſame</hi> thing by <hi>both Charts,</hi> by which the <hi>Errours</hi> may more palpably be diſcovered.

                     </head>
                     <p>A <hi>Sea-Chart</hi> may be made either <hi>general,</hi> or <hi>particular.</hi> A <hi>General Sea-Chart</hi> is that whoſe Degrees of <hi>Latitude</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the <hi>Aequinoctial</hi> to either <hi>Pole,</hi> which in the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sea-Chart</hi> may be done; but it will be egregiouſly falſe, as the Degrees of <hi>Latitude</hi> grow nearer the <hi>Pole,</hi> as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready declared.—A <hi>Particular Sea-Chart</hi> is ſuch a one as is made properly for one particular <hi>Navigation:</hi> as if your
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:30341:90"/> whole <hi>Navigation</hi> were not to exceed the <hi>Latitudes</hi> of 48 and 60 degr. of <hi>Latitude,</hi> and not to differ in <hi>Longitude</hi> above 8 degrees.</p>
                     <p>Now to <hi>project</hi> or <hi>make</hi> ſuch a <hi>Chart;</hi> Firſt, draw a right Line A B, repreſenting the <hi>Meridian,</hi> and croſs it at right Angles in the Point A with another right Line A D, repreſenting the <hi>Parallel</hi> of your leaſt <hi>Latitude,</hi> namely, of 48 degr.— Secondly, conſider what Diſtance you will have your <hi>Parallels of Longitude</hi> and <hi>Latitude</hi> to be, (for in this <hi>Chart</hi> they are both equal,) whether an Inch, 2, 3, or 4 Inches, (for the lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the better.) But in this Example I have made them one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly half an Inch. I take therefore half an Inch out of an exact <hi>Scale,</hi> and run it up upon the <hi>Meridian Line</hi> A B, from A to 49, from 49 to 50, from 50 to 51, &amp;c. till I come to my greateſt <hi>Latitude,</hi> which is here ſuppoſed to be 60 degr.—Thirdly, run the ſame Diſtance of half an Inch from A towards D, upon the Line A D, eight times, becauſe the Difference of <hi>Longitude</hi> in your whole <hi>Navigation</hi> will not exceed 8 degrees.— Fourthly, draw the Line C D, parallel to A B, and B C, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allel to A D, and run the ſame Diſtances upon the Line B C as are upon the Line A D, and the ſame upon C D as are upon the Line A B.—Fifthly, from each Degree of <hi>Latitude</hi> in the Line A B draw to the like Degree of <hi>Latitude</hi> in the Line C D a right Line, as 49, 49; 50, 50; 51, 51; 52, 52; &amp;c. till you have drawn all your <hi>Parallels</hi> of <hi>Latitude.</hi>—Sixthly, for your <hi>Meridians,</hi> they are to be drawn in like manner as were the <hi>Parallels</hi> of <hi>Latitude,</hi> all of them equidiſtant, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allel to your firſt <hi>Meridian</hi> A B, as the Lines 1, 1; 2, 2; 3, 3; &amp;c. And by this means have you the <hi>Meridians</hi> and <hi>Parallels</hi> drawn.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>grand Diviſions,</hi> or <hi>whole Degrees,</hi> being thus ſet upon your <hi>Chart,</hi> we now come to ſub-divide them. And for the dividing of the Degrees of the <hi>Aequinoctial</hi> at the top and bottom of your <hi>Chart,</hi> let each of them be divided into 5 or 10 parts, and each of thoſe parts ſub-divided into 5 or 10
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:30341:91"/> more leſs parts, according as Quantity will permit; for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them is ſuppoſed to be divided into 100 or 1000 parts.</p>
                     <p>For the dividing of the <hi>Degrees of Latitude;</hi> they may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided as thoſe of <hi>Longitude</hi> were, into 100 parts. But ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times each Degree is ſubdivided into 60 <hi>Minutes,</hi> or <hi>Engliſh Miles,</hi> or into 20 <hi>Leagues.</hi>—Now I have divided the <hi>Degrees of Latitude</hi> in this <hi>Chart</hi> each of them into 5 parts, by which means it is capable of the <hi>Numeration</hi> either by <hi>Miles, Leagues, Centeſms,</hi> or 100 parts.—For if you count by 60 <hi>minutes,</hi> or <hi>miles,</hi> then every of thoſe Diviſions will be 12 <hi>minutes,</hi> or <hi>miles;</hi> if by 20 <hi>Leagues,</hi> then every Diviſion will contain 4 <hi>Leagues;</hi> and if by <hi>Centeſms</hi> or 100 parts, then every of them is 20 <hi>Centeſms.</hi> And thus much concerning the <hi>Making</hi> or <hi>Projecting</hi> of this <hi>Chart.</hi> I now come to ſhew</p>

And from the Point A (through each Degree of the Quadrant) draw right Lines, as A 10, 10; A 20, 20; A 30, 30; A 40, 40; &amp;c. to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards 90. till they touch the Line D F.—Then with your

Again, extend the Compaſſes from A to 55 in the Line F D, and keeping one foot in A, with the other deſcribe 55 K; ſo ſhall the Point K be the Point of 55 degr. in the Line A B.—Alſo, extend the Compaſſes from A to 50 in the Line F D, and draw the Arch 50, 50. Doe ſo with 45, 40, 35, &amp;c. till you come to the beginning of the Degrees at D. So ſhall theſe Arch-lines, by meeting with the Line A B, divide that part of it D B into unequal parts, at 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and ſo forward. But this Figure is ſufficient for Example.</p>

                     <p>Now from this Line A B, being thus unequally divided, you may divide the Meridian-line of a Sea-Chart according to <hi>Mercator</hi>'s Projection of any bigneſs, ſo that the Diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Degree and Degree in the Aequinoctial be leſs then the Diſtance A D, which is here two Inches. And if a Chart were made that the Aequinoctial Degrees were two Inches di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and it paſſed upon a ſmooth Board, many Nauticall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions might be wrought upon it very exactly. Being thus far prepared, I will now ſhew you how, from the Line A B,</p>
                     <div type="solution">
                        <head>To divide the Meridian Line of a Sea-Chart.</head>
                        <p>A Sea-Chart, according to this Projection, may be made either General, or Particular. I call that a General Sea-Chart, whoſe Line E H, in the following Figure, repreſents the Aequinoctial, as the Line E H there doth the Parallel of 49 degr. and ſo I will make the Chart following to contain all Latitudes between 49 degr. and 57 degr. whoſe Difference of Longitude exceedeth not 8 degr.</p>
                        <p>Now to project ſuch a Chart, having drawn the Line E F for the Meridian, and croſſed it at right Angles with another Line repreſenting the Parallel of 49 d. parallel thereto draw another Line F G, repreſenting the Parallel of 57 degr. and another Meridian G H, parallel to F E. So ſhall you have made the Parallelogram E F G H.</p>
                        <p>This done, conſider how far diſtant you would have your Degrees of Longitude upon the Aequinoctial each from other, as ſuppoſe (and as in this Chart I have made them to be) half an Inch. Take half an Inch out of a Line of Inches, and run that Diſtance along the Line E H from E to 1, from 1 to 2, from 2 to 3, &amp;c. And alſo doe the like upon the Line F G, at the top of the Chart, drawing the Lines 1, 1; 2, 2; 3, 3; &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Now for the Dividing of the Meridians E F and H G, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to the foregoing Figure, taking in your Compaſſes the Diſtance that is between Degree and Degree of the Aequino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctial,
<pb facs="tcp:30341:101"/>

                           <pb n="177" facs="tcp:30341:102"/>which in our Example is half an Inch. With this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſet one foot of the Compaſſes in the Point D, and with the other deſcribe the Arch <hi>m m;</hi> by the very Edge whereof draw the Line A G: ſo is your Figure prepared to divide the Meridian-line of a Sea-Chart whoſe Degrees of Longitude are half an Inch diſtant.</p>
                        <p>Now in reſpect that your firſt Parallel of Latitude E H in your Chart is drawn for 49 degr. your next Parallel muſt be 50 degr. Wherefore ſet one foot of your Compaſſes upon 50 degr. in the Line A B, and with the other take the neareſt Diſtance to the Line A G: that is done by turning the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes about till the moveable foot do onely touch the Line A G; which when it ſo doth, that Diſtance at which your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes then are, being ſet upon the Meridian of your Chart, will reach from 49 degr. to 50, which being ſet upon your Chart, on both ſides thereof, from 49 draw the Line 50. 50 will give you the Parallel of 50 d. of Latitude. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for the Parallel of 51 degr. Set one foot of the Compaſſes in 51 degr. upon the Line A B of the former Figure, and with the other take the leaſt Diſtance to the Line A G: this Diſtance ſet upon the Meridian of your Sea-Chart, on both ſides thereof, will reach from 50 to 51; and there draw the Parallel 51, 51.—Likewiſe for the Parallel of 52 degr. Set one foot of the Compaſſes in 52 degr. in the Line A B, taking the neareſt Diſtance to the Line A G: that Diſtance ſet upon the Meridian of your Sea-Chart, on both ſides thereof, will reach from 51 to 52; and there draw the Parallel of 52, 52. Doe thus with all the Degrees, as 53, 54, 55, 56, and 57. So ſhall the Meridians of your Chart E F and H G be divided into whole Degrees.</p>
                        <p>For the Sub-diviſions of theſe Degrees, they may be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded each of them into equal parts, as the Diviſions at the top and bottome of the Chart ought to be; but the Degrees of the Meridian, as they grow higher, they ought ſtill to grow greater. But the Difference is ſo ſmall, that it cannot produce
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:30341:103"/> any conſiderable Errour, though the Sub-diviſions be all made equal between Degree and Degree. You may therefore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide them either into 60 Minutes or Engliſh Miles, or into 20 Leagues, or into 100 parts of Degrees, as you ſhall beſt like of.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But if you would make a Chart that the Diſtance between De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and Degree upon the Aequinoctial ſhould be an Inch, or any other Diſtance leſs then A D in the foregoing Figure; take that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance (as ſuppoſe an Inch) in your Compaſſes, and ſetting one foot in D, with the other deſcribe the Arch</hi> o o, <hi>and draw the Line A H onely to touch the Arch</hi> o o. <hi>The leaſt Diſtance taken from each Degree to this Line A H ſhall give you the Diſtance of the Degrees upon the Meridian of a Sea-Chart, whoſe Diſtance of Degrees up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Aequinoctial are an Inch from each other.</hi>

                        <p>THrough the given Latitude A draw a Meridian AB, and a Parallel A D, and upon the Parallel ſet the Difference of Longitude 5 ½ d. taken from the bottom of the Chart, from A to D, and through D draw the Meridian D C.

So is 55 d. the Latitude of the other Place, and 50 being taken from 55, leaves 5 d. for the Difference of Latitudes required.</p>

                        <p>Through the two given Latitudes 50 d. and 52 ½, at A and O draw two Parallels, O P and A D, upon which ſet the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Longitudes from O to P, and from A to Q, 6 degr. Then draw the Line A P, which ſhall be the Line of the Rhumb leading from one Place to the other: wherefore, by your Chord or Protracting Quadrant find the quantity of the Angle O A P, which ſhall be the Inclination of the Rhumb to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian, and will be found to be 56 d. 15 m. that is the N. E. by E. Point; which was the Firſt thing that was required.</p>
                        <p>Then to find the proper Diſtance upon the Rhumb; Take the Line A P in your Compaſſes, and meaſure it upon the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian-line, ſo that one foot may be above the greater Latitude ſo much as the other is below the leſſer; and you will find the Compaſs-points to reſt in E and S, E being one whole Degree below the leſſer Latitude, and S one Degree above the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

                        <p>THE Rhumb-Line A P being drawn, ſet off thereupon 36 Leagues (which was the way that the Ship made upon the fifth Rhumb before the Wind changed) from A to T, (which Diſtance muſt be taken out of the Meridian-line by opening the Compaſſes from 50 d. to 51, 48. or better, to as much below 50 d. as above 51 d.) So ſhall the Point T be the Place that the Ship was in when the Wind altered. So a Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel drawn through T upon the Chart will cut the Meridian at V in 51 d. and in that Latitude the Ship was. Now to find in what Longitude ſhe was; Take in your Compaſſes the Line T V, and meaſure it at the bottom of the Chart, you ſhall find it will reach from E to 2 d. 21 m. And in that Longitude the Ship then was.</p>
                        <p>This done, upon the Point T (where the Wind changed, and drove the Ship 2 Points more Eaſtwardly, namely, upon the E. by N. Point) protract an Angle of 22 d. 30 m. namely, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle P T X, which is the Rhumb upon which the Ship ſailed 50 Leagues after the Wind changed. Therefore take 50 Leagues out of the Meridian-line, and ſet them from T to X. So ſhall X be the Place that the Ship was in after ſhe had ſailed 50 Leagues upon the E. by N. Point; which, by drawing a Parallel through K, will be found in the Latitude of 51 d. 30 m. and by drawing of a Meridian through K alſo, it will be found to be in the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude of 6 degr. 16 min.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But if theſe Courſes had been protracted according to the Plain Sea-Chart, the Point T would fall in the Latitude of</hi> 51 <hi>degr. and the Point X in the Latitude of</hi> 51 <hi>degr.</hi> 30 <hi>m. But the Longitude of T would be onely</hi> 1 <hi>d.</hi> 30 <hi>m. and the Longitude of X in</hi> 3 <hi>d.</hi> 57 <hi>min. Both theſe Longitudes being added, make but</hi> 5 <hi>d.</hi> 27 <hi>m. for the Difference of Longitude between X and the firſt Meridian; whereas by the other Chart it is</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> 16 <hi>m. So that the Ship at X is</hi> 33 <hi>m. Weſtward of the Place to which ſhe was bound.</hi>
